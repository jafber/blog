This year I took part in [Junction](https://www.hackjunction.com/), one of the largest hackathons in Europe! Over the course of the weekend, we developed MonoPlan, a software solution to intelligently create 3D building models from technical drawings. **Check out the web app at [monoplan.jan-berndt.de](https://monoplan.jan-berndt.de/)!**

Our team, consisting of 5 friends from University, took on the "BIM for everyone" Challenge sponsored by KONE, a large producer of elevators.

Thanks to the HPI for the cool T-Shirts! For the final submission, we created this pitch video:

If you're interested in the nitty gritty details, the [Github Repo](https://github.com/DanielC04/Junction2024) is public. Just don't look too closely at the spaghetti code.
