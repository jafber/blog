Our exhilarating couch-co-op-game "Anni's Hilation"  won the 18th HPI GameJam! Play it right now on the [itch.io page](https://saraqael-m.itch.io/annis-hilation)!

## Anni's Hilation

> Mad scientist Prof. Anni has created herself a friendly humanoid companion out of old body parts she found in the local graveyard. The creature, going by the name of Hilation, now has to protect it's maker from evil spirits that have been awoken by the unholy experiment. Steer Hilation to fend off the foes, but be careful - it's body is not holding together all too well! Whenever an arm or a leg falls off, rush in with Anni to patch the monster back together before the both of you get circled by the undead!

## The GameJam

The HPI GameJam is held bianually at my university's computer science faculty, the Hasso Plattner Institute. In a team of 4 students, we developed the game over the course of one weekend as a twist on the jam's theme "Architects of Annihilation". Check out all the games [here](https://itch.io/jam/hpi-gamedev-klub-jam-18).
