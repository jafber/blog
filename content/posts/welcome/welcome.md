Hi, thanks for checking out my site. I set it up in late 2024 because my old side projects looked sad just sitting around on my hard drive. This means I retroactively wrote most of the posts here and changed their dates to fit the timeline. Whatever, I make the rules.

If for some reason you've stumbled accross this blog by chance and you have any questions about my work, my studies or whatever comes to mind, send me an email at [web@jan-berndt.de](mailto:web@jan-berndt.de). Seriously! I'd be super stoked.
