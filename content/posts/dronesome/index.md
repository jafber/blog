Over the past 2 years, a friend and I have developed a delivery drone for covid tests. We've ended up with a prototype able to autonomously steer itself to points of interests which users put in from a web application. The project achieved a 4th place in the nationwide compeition Jugend Forscht, the special prize by the German Aerospace Center, and the 2nd place of the Hans-Riegel-Fachpreis curated by the University of Potsdam.

Our local TV station lausitz.tv even did a segment about us:

For our submission, we created [this paper](/posts/dronesome/jufo-compressed.pdf) (also in German, and keep in mind we were still in high school when we wrote this):
