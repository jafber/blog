A [DualPanto](https://hpi.de/baudisch/projects/dualpanto.html) is a haptic device allowing vision impaired users to apply input and receive feedback from a computer in real time using steering handles. Through the Building Interactive Systems class at the Hasso Plattner Institute, my teammate and I assembled a DualPanto, programmed parts of its firmware and developed a game for it in Unity.
