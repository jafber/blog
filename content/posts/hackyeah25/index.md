Second time's the charm.
Ever since friends and I went to [HackJunction](../junction24) last year, we were aching to get another hackathon fix.
Naturally we came across HackYeah, the self-proclaimed "biggest hackathon in Europe" and we knew we just had to give it a chance.
So this year we made a roadtrip out to Krakow, competing against over 2000 fellow hackers to develop an awesome idea in one of the dozen-or-so categories of the competition.

In just 24 hours, we developed [deciv.eu](https://deciv.jan-berndt.de) - the central European platform for monitoring cyber attacks.

## Try it out!

- Look around the map above or head directly to [deciv.eu](https://deciv.jan-berndt.de) on your laptop (the layout doesn't really work on phones).
- Click on one of the honeypots in the left panel to see its details.
- Use the "Deploy" button on the top right to actually create your own node on the map, visible to the whole world!

## How it works

Honeypots are small servers that act as decoys to attackers, imitating the behavior of real systems, but really constantly gathering information on potential cyber attacks being run against a system.
Deciv allows government security officials to quickly deploy honeypots across critical infrastructure networks and monitor their condition in real time.
That's the idea at least - so far the "critical infrastructure" is just some demo honeypots in my home server's database.

## Thanks
